WordPress Functionality Customizations and Extensions
 
 Introduction
   
   This functions.php file is a dynamic and continuously evolving script for customizing WordPress functionality.
   It serves as the backbone for adding bespoke features, optimizing processes, and adapting the WordPress environment
   to specific project needs. The codebase within this file will be regularly updated and extended, allowing for the
   seamless integration of new capabilities as requirements evolve.
  
   Key Objectives:
  1. Enhance the flexibility and functionality of WordPress beyond its default behavior.
  2. Include clean, well-documented code for ease of understanding, maintenance, and collaboration.
  3. Provide a centralized location for managing all custom modifications and hooks.
